Salla E-commerce Project - Vue.js Developer | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap | API | Vue.js | PHP Laravel.
When I was working on this pure virgin project with Nodejs 20.10.0, when downloading the project you need to do (npm install) and then write the command (npm run serve )in the terminal for the front end part.
The back-end part requires the xampp Version 8.1.6-0 program.
You will need to run the command (composer install) in the terminal, then execute the command (php artisan migrate:fresh --seed) to create the tables for the database, then execute the command (php artisan serve) to run the server.
